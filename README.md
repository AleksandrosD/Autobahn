Video Timelines
- **00:00 to 00:30:** Our introduction page displays four of our main cars on the website (Porsche, AUDI, Mercedes, BMW). There are three main buttons on the top right: Services, Inventory, and Login.

- **02:50 to 03:50:** Examining detailed information about the cars, such as miles, price, horsepower, transmission, drivetrain, engine, and color. Additionally, there's a text description of the car and a "Contact Us" window where the buyer can input their information to reach out to the dealer for more details and schedule a test drive.

- **03:50 to 04:20:** Services page where car owners can find the nearest service center for their vehicles with specialized technicians.
